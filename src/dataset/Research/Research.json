        "content" : "My current research is genetic regulatory network (GRN) inference. The aim is to study collection of molecular regulators that interact with each other and with other substances in the cell to govern the gene expression levels of mRNA and proteins which, in turn, determine the function of the cell. Having regulatory network structure is very important because it contains only information about the controlling regulations of gene expression, protein interaction networks represent information about protein-protein complexes. Also, information about temporal changes in the network structure are important to understand immune response, infection and differentiation processes."

Moreover, the globalization, the reciprocity the markets become, we have try to make Machine Learning model exploit interconnection in cross-market."
