                        Complex systems can create emergent dynamical behaviors by simple interactions between components. 
                        We aim to develop computational methods to investigate the principles behind various complex systems.<br/><br/>
                        In biological systems, we try to unravel a network consisting of biological components, discover a relationship between structural and dynamical characteristics, and predict a disease causality.<br/><br/>
                        In the financial systems, we try to construct a correlation network between different markets, discover a latent feature, and predict a future of financial variables.<br/><br/>
                        In the engineering field, we try to develop an automatic machine learning framework which can efficiently solve a variety of optimization problems, and apply it to not only the complex systems problems but also the real-world applications.<br/>
                        We enjoy making interesting questions and answering them freely.
